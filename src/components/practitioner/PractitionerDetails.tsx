// This file has been removed to streamline the practitioner management flow.
// Users now go directly from the practitioners list to the management page:
// List of Practitioners -> Manage Practitioner (no intermediate details page)

// This eliminates unnecessary navigation steps and simplifies the user experience.
// All practitioner details and actions are now consolidated in the PractitionerManagement component.
