Review {child_name}'s Wellbeing Wheel check-ins to understand their emotional and psychological wellbeing from a therapeutic perspective. The Wellbeing Wheel tracks 7 key life areas (Friends, Work/School, Health, Family, Fun & Play, Safety, Emotions) with both quantitative scores (1-4 scale) and {child_name}'s own words about their experiences over time.

This between-session data provides valuable insights into their daily experiences, therapeutic progress, and how different areas of their life interconnect.

**Person-Centered Clinical Focus:**
1. Patterns across all 7 wellbeing categories and how they interact
2. Emotional regulation as reflected in the Emotions category and its relationship to other areas
3. Social-emotional development visible in Friends, Family, and Safety categories
4. Areas showing consistent strength or declining patterns
5. {child_name}'s own narrative through their text responses
6. Protective factors and natural support systems emerging from their responses
7. Collaborative treatment approaches that build on their strengths across all categories
