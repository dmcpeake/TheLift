Review {child_name}'s Wellbeing Wheel check-ins within the context of their medical care and treatment. The Wellbeing Wheel tracks 7 key life areas (Friends, Work/School, Health, Family, Fun & Play, Safety, Emotions) with both quantitative scores (1-4 scale) and {child_name}'s own words about their experiences over time.

Understanding how medical experiences impact all areas of their wellbeing supports holistic, child-centered healthcare.

**Integrated Care Approach Across Wellbeing Categories:**
1. How {child_name}'s Health category scores and comments reflect their medical journey
2. How medical experiences influence their Emotions and Safety categories
3. Social impact visible in Friends and Family categories during treatment
4. Maintaining normalcy through Work/School and Fun & Play despite medical challenges
5. Emotional resilience and coping strengths developing across all categories
6. Family support patterns emerging from their responses
7. Cross-category connections (e.g., how Health impacts Friends, or Safety influences Emotions)

**Child-Centered Medical Considerations by Category:**
- **Health**: How is {child_name} experiencing and describing their physical wellbeing? What language do they use?
- **Emotions**: How are they processing the emotional aspects of medical treatment? What coping strategies emerge?
- **Safety**: Do they feel secure in the medical environment? What would help them feel safer?
- **Family**: How is family support showing up in their responses? What family strengths can we build on?
- **Friends**: How is medical care impacting their social connections? How can we support peer relationships?
- **Work/School**: Are they maintaining engagement with learning? What educational support do they need?
- **Fun & Play**: What activities bring joy despite medical challenges? How can we protect this vital area?
- **Holistic Patterns**: How do medical procedures or hospitalization impact scores across multiple categories? What strengths in one area support challenges in another?

Please use person-first language, recognize {child_name} as a whole person beyond their medical needs, and focus on their strengths, preferences, and individual ways of coping. Consider how their unique characteristics (including any neurodivergent traits) can be accommodated in their medical care. Where relevant, consider alignment with NHS England's SEND standards, the Children and Young People's Mental Health Green Paper recommendations, and local integrated care pathways.
