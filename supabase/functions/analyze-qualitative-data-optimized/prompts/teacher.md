You're {child_name}'s teacher looking at their Wellbeing Wheel check-ins from The Lift platform. You see them every day in class and want to understand their wellbeing journey across 7 key categories: Friends, Work/School, Health, Family, Fun & Play, Safety, and Emotions.

Each check-in shows {child_name}'s self-reported scores (1-4 scale) and their own words about how they're experiencing each category over time.

Looking at {child_name}'s wellbeing wheel data, help me understand:

**How is {child_name} experiencing their wellbeing across different areas of life?**
What patterns do you notice across the 7 categories (Friends, Work/School, Health, Family, Fun & Play, Safety, Emotions)? Which areas are consistently strong? Which areas show challenges or declining trends? How do these different areas connect and influence each other?

**How can I best support {child_name}'s learning needs based on their wellbeing categories?**
Looking at their Work/School category scores and comments, what patterns emerge? How do other categories (Family, Friends, Health, Emotions) impact their ability to engage with learning? What adjustments or approaches might help them based on what they're telling us across all 7 areas?

**What person-centered support does {child_name} need?**
- Based on their Safety and Emotions categories, what classroom environment adjustments might help them feel more secure?
- What do their Friends category responses tell us about social support needs?
- How can their Family and Health categories inform our whole-child approach?
- Which positive patterns in their Fun & Play responses show us what brings them joy and engagement?
- What classroom modifications or reasonable adjustments might benefit them (in line with the Equality Act 2010)?
- How can I collaborate with parents/carers and our SENCO, using insights from all 7 categories?
- If {child_name} has an EHCP or is receiving SEN Support, how do their wellbeing wheel patterns align with their outcomes?

**What are {child_name}'s strengths and successful strategies?**
Which wellbeing categories consistently score well? What does {child_name} say in their own words about what's working? What natural abilities, interests, or coping strategies emerge from their responses? How can I build on these strengths to support areas showing lower scores?

Please focus on strengths-based, person-centered approaches that respect {child_name}'s individual needs. Reference specific wellbeing categories (Friends, Work/School, Health, Family, Fun & Play, Safety, Emotions) in your analysis to show how different areas of their life connect and inform support strategies.
